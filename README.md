This module allows you to create word clouds using d3. Please note that this requires
D3 and also d3.layout.cloud.js (which can be taken from https://jardindesconnaissances.googlecode.com/svn-history/r82/trunk/public/js/d3.layout.cloud.js.

You can modify cloud height, width, pick colors for most and least often occurring words, and adjust
the scale of the words created (more often occurring words are larger by definition).

Input text needs to be in the format of a simple string: words separated by spaces. Special characters are cleaned.
